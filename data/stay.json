The kitchen has everything you need with Alex and Shalia stocking it with a few basics. The neighbourhood is a little shabby, especially compared to the home we stayed in.

Walking from the subway after dark was a little daunting but we remained safe. We did catch a cab a few times from Manhattan as it was very late. Overall, it was a positive experience with Alex and Shalia being very helpful, even going out of their way to let us store our luggage at Shalia's work the day we were to fly out.

We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

We could have breakfast at her place which was perfect because she has a little sweet balcony! \r\nLocation: calmly situated in a side street, very near to the Placa Catalunya, the Rambla and the gothic area of Barcelona (very beautiful:)) so you have the old cultural center as well as all the restaurants and bars just nearby.\r\nHouse/Room: the appartment is not a huge, but I think you have everything you need (beautiful sitting room, balcony, kitchen) in it. You have to share the appartment with Marian so pay attention and don't be too loud in the evening!!\r\ndisadvantage: the heat is terrible in summer and there is no air-condition..\r\n\r\nI would overall recommend it to everybody!!

				"txt": "Isa is a very lovely, sensitive, artistic and gorgeous person. She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"

				"txt": "The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day "

The area is not very posh, but, for me, it feels like home, so I tend to stay there whenever I go to New York. The listing description was accurate enough, with respect to the way the apartment looks. If you can't deal with noise at night, however, this might not be the place for you. The neighbors were surprisingly noisy in the wee hours of the night and virtually silent during the day. This apartment is close to the subway, which was very useful."

Se mantuvo en contacto con nosotros y fue muy comprensivo aún cuando llegamos más tarde de la hora acordada para el check in porque nos perdimos en el subway. También fue muy comprensivo para acordar el check out de acuerdo a la hora que fue más conveniente para nosotros, aún cuando también se nos hizo tarde. Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría! Muchas Gracias Kevin por tu ayuda!"

The apartment has all the basic things--it's especially nice to have a kitchen and comfy sofa. There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city."

Aun que no está en el mismo centro de la ciudad se llega a el en un paseo de poco más de 10 mins, además en la misma puerta hay una parada de metro. Ha sido una experiencia genial quedarnos aquí para visitar la ciudad. Muchas gracias por la amabilidad, si volvemos a la ciudad no dudaríamos en volver a quedarnos aquí."

Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others."

From the moment we booked Cynthia could not have been more helpful with everything and was always ready and willing to answer all of our queries. Cynthia provided us with an extensive list of recommendations for our stay on Maui and we were not disappointed. The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia "

It was really easy to run up to the Condo for my 9-month old nap times or a quick snack, without being too separated from the family.  The onsite pools, restaurant and of course restaurant/bar became our home bases for the week.  Miso Phat Sushi (across the street) and Maui Brewing were awesome near-by/within walking distance restaurants.  My family and I can't stop bragging about our trip and what a wonderful family/group set-up this Condo is!  We recommend renting a car due to the distance from the airport, but the Condo/Resort has onsite parking."

The kitchen has everything you need, and the barbques downstairs were perfect for grilling.  Cynthia left us plenty of information for dining in the vicinity, so we had 3 nice dinners out. The guide she sent us before our visit was very informative and helped us to plan our outings while in Maui. Cynthia also checked in with us during our visit, making sure we had everything we needed.

While climbing nine flights of stairs during an unexpected elevator renovation (that ends in May!) does not sound fun, it was actually not bad at all for the adults in our party, as well as the 3 sub-8 year old children, and allowed us to think we were earning all the delicious calories we ate and drank.\n\nI cannot rave enough about the amenities that are incredibly family friendly, including a full sized high chair, travel crib, toddler (and big kid) friendly toys for both indoors and at the beach. Cynthia is very quick to respond to communication and is clear as to what she can provide as a host, as well as her expectation of guests. She was as incredible as her Kahana home was and we'd highly recommend this place for anyone, including those with small children."

I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "

L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento. L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. "

I would only say that the check out time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city when you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina allowed us nicely to stay until 12pm.\r\nThey were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r\nI have suggested to regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided such as toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were very pleased with our stay at Regina's place.

The building is in a residential (read: non-touristy) part of Spain so if you are looking for a real taste of local culture this is the place to stay. 2 blocks from the subway and we were downtown in just a couple stops. The apartment is in building with a common courtyard (common for the style). The other people that live in the building were very friendly and helpful answering any questions we had. My son was even able to play with the other children (despite the language barrier). Awesome experience -- would definietly rent again."

The neighborhood is well situated - it is not at all touristy but close to transportation at Plaza España and Poble Sec metro stops so you can easily get to all the places you want to visit. We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. "

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs."

				"txt": "麻雀虽小,五脏俱全!很干净也很舒适,感觉有如在自己家似的｡下次如果想尝试在九龍岛住还会想要和 Michelle&May 定香港住宿｡谢谢她的亲切友善与小礼物｡(Hope I'm using the appropriate chinese words!)\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleasant first experience with Airbnb with Michelle&May. Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)"

She was there to meet us both times that we stayed with her and went above and beyond to make our stays comfortable. The apartment is smallish but is to be expected in HK. Plus with so much to do in HK, you'll hardly be home anyway! The location is great and close to East TST and TST MTR stations, making it easy to get around to other areas. It is close to the heart of TST with great food and shopping options within walking distance. I would definitely recommend Michelle's apartment!"

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

The view was beautiful, the kitchen was fantastically equipped, the condo community went very quiet at night and the lovely sounds of the ocean waves rocked you to sleep each night. We were there in January and it was quite pleasant all day, but I think during the hotter months the front bedroom could get warmer. All bedrooms had windows that would open and most of time there was a strong breeze blowing through the entire condo. The general location, central Maui, was perfect as well. Just an excellent place to vacation."

Its great to get a drink just downstairs but it can get a bit noisy at night on the weekends.  (Because the buildings are so close together, any normal conversation seems loud as the sound bounces off the buildings)  Overall, Luis has an awesome place and I would definitely come back next year when I visit Barcelona."

The other 2 bedrooms are in the back and are quieter. You will hear the neighbors upstairs when they walk around, but this was not a problem at night.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is lively and has lots of restaurants. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. Metro stops are a 10-15 minute walk. Parc Jeanne-Mance is a block away and great for an evening picnic.\r\n\r\nFlatbook was very responsive via phone and email (though email sometimes took several hours to be answered)."

It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay.  The kitchen had all of the utensils and dishes necessary to prepare meals in if wanted.  The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!"

Mia moglie, io e i tre bambini non abbiamo potuto fermarci neanche un minuto per le pessime condizioni in cui abbiamo trovato l'appartamento. Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."

Also two blocks away you have the E train that also goes into Manhattan and the G train that goes into Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nIn the area there's still a cozy and cheap diner that's open 24/7, a few stores to get supplies and a few other places of interest. Location was excellent, 10 minutes away from everything.\r\n\r\nThe room was great and packed with a mini fridge, coffee maker, TV, a sofa, full size bed and walk-in closet. There was also a private bathroom that had everything you needed and a very good shower.\r\n\r\nThere's also a garden out back where you can go outside in the mornings and just relax, eat breakfast, etc.\r\n\r\nOrestes was a great host and gave me a lot of good spots to go sightseeing. Good person to chat with and quite knowledgeable about the city.\r\n\r\nI think that for the price, you simply can't get any better."

				"txt": "What a wonderful holiday and a wonderful place to stay! We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x"

We met Orestes briefly, as he was out of town most of the time, and he is extremely hospitable and helpful.  Chris, who was around the rest of the time, was also kind and available for any questions.\r\nThe location is convenient to a grocery store, decent diner, and several subway lines; it's pretty simple to get to Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.\r\nFuture guests should be aware that while the guest room itself might be non-smoking, the rest of the house isn't.  Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice."

До метро Poble Sec три минуты ходьбы.Для нас оказался необычным подъезд, лестница и правда узкая и высокая, об этом все тут пишут, если есть проблемы со здоровьем, лучше не рисковать. Удачное расположение квартиры позволяет экономить на проезде, до площади Испании и фонтана Монжуик десять минут, до площади Каталонии чуть подальше. Рядом много кафе и магазинов. Из-за рабочего графика Монс, мы видели ее очень редко, поэтому фактически вся квартира была в нашем распоряжении. Это был наш первый опыт с airbnb и он оказался удачным."

The location is perfect and within walking distance of lots of great food and Montreal sights. Our room had a fan but others might find the lack of air conditioning challenging in the summer. We had a really nice stay."

				"txt": "Jen was very welcoming and responsive.  She and her friend provided a delicious and substantive breakfast in the morning.  Nice neighborhood right on St. Denis.  Large sunny room with comfy queen mattress. Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and ktichen.  Couple of things: 1)  there are two bathrooms- one with toilet, the other with sink and bathtub.  The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.\r\n"

				"txt": " We strongly recommend this location. We would surely stay here again in the future.\r\nNOTE: There are 3 rooms at this location. 2 of them face St Denis, and this is a busy street with traffic noise. The 1 room in the back, away from St Denis, is much quieter. This is our favorite room.\r\nThe location, one block from Metro/Laurier is excellent. The building is from 1890, and has a lot of character. There are 2 flights of stairs to get up to the rooms.\r\nJen is a very welcoming and conscientious host. She went beyond our expectations and helped us with some issues with our room and the AirBNB website. We are most appreciative.\r\nBreakfast was very good.\r\nWe stayed here for one week. in 2 of the 3 rooms. (BTW: The beds in these 2 rooms are folders, and are a bit harder than we like.)"

Yummy, filling breakfast was a great start to each morning!"
