The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.\r\n"

The building is from 1890, and has a lot of character. There are 2 flights of stairs to get up to the rooms.\r\nJen is a very welcoming and conscientious host. She went beyond our expectations and helped us with some issues with our room and the AirBNB website.
